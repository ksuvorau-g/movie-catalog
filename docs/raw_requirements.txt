MOVIE CATALOG - RAW REQUIREMENTS
=================================

PROJECT OVERVIEW
-----------------
A REST API service for managing a personal movie and TV series catalog. The system allows users to track movies they want to watch, mark them as watched or unwatched, get recommendations for what to watch next, and track TV series progress with automatic notifications for new season releases.


CORE FEATURES
-------------

1. ADD NEW MOVIE
   - Users can add a new movie to their catalog
   - Each movie entry must include:
     * Title
     * Link (URL where the movie can be accessed)
     * Text comment (personal notes or review)
     * Cover image link (URL to movie poster/thumbnail)
     * Length (duration of the movie)
     * Genre
   
2. MARK MOVIE AS WATCHED/UNWATCHED
   - Users can mark any movie in their catalog as "watched"
   - Users can change the status back to "unwatched" if needed
   - The system should track the current watch status of each movie

2a. SET MOVIE/SERIES PRIORITY
   - Users can manually increase or decrease priority for any movie or series
   - Priority is a numeric value (higher = more likely to be recommended)
   - Default priority is 0
   - Priority can be adjusted through API to boost specific content in recommendations

3. GET MOVIE RECOMMENDATION
   - Users can request a recommendation for the next movie to watch
   - Recommendation logic:
     * Both movies and TV series are included in recommendations
     * For movies: Only unwatched movies are considered
     * For series: Only series with unwatched seasons are considered
     * Probability is weighted by how long ago the movie/series was added (older items have higher probability)
     * Manual priority can be set through API to boost specific movies/series (higher priority = higher chance)
     * Special case for series: If all previously available seasons were watched and new season(s) were added, series gets very high probability to appear on top
     * Random selection applied with the age-based weighting (except for series with new seasons which have priority)
     * Example: A movie/series added a year ago has higher chance than one added yesterday
     * Example priority: High manual priority > Series with new seasons > Old unwatched items > Recently added unwatched items

4. RETRIEVE FULL CATALOG LIST
   - Users can get a complete list of all movies and TV series in their catalog
   - List capabilities:
     * Filtering: Support filtering by:
       - Genre, watch status, added by (person name)
       - Content type (movies only, series only, or both)
       - Series-specific: series with new unwatched seasons, complete vs. ongoing series
     * Sorting: 
       - All unwatched movies and series ALWAYS appear first in the catalog, regardless of other sorting criteria
       - Support sorting by title, length (for movies), date added (applied within unwatched/watched groups)
       - Default sort: unwatched items first, then by date added (newest first)
     * Pagination: Optional feature that can be implemented if needed for large catalogs

5. ADD NEW TV SERIES
   - Users can add a TV series to their catalog
   - Each series entry must include at least a title
   - Series can include the same optional fields as movies (link, description, comment, cover image, genre, added by)
   - Series have additional tracking for season progress

6. MARK SERIES SEASON AS WATCHED/UNWATCHED
   - Users can mark individual seasons as watched or unwatched
   - Users can mark an entire series as watched (all seasons marked as watched)
   - Users can mark an entire series as unwatched (all seasons marked as unwatched)
   - Series watch status is automatically determined:
     * Series is "watched" if all available seasons are marked as watched
     * Series is "unwatched" if any season is marked as unwatched
   - Users can skip seasons (e.g., mark Season 3 as watched without watching Season 2)
   - No episode-level tracking - seasons are marked manually as a whole

7. AUTOMATIC SEASON REFRESH AND NOTIFICATIONS
   - System periodically checks for new seasons (e.g., weekly)
   - System fetches latest season information from external sources (link description URLs)
   - Notifications are displayed when new seasons are detected for series where at least one season has been watched
   - Notifications persist until manually dismissed by the user
   - Notifications inform user which series has new seasons available
   - If external source is unavailable:
     * System retries in one hour
     * User can manually trigger a refresh check
   - If series has no link description URL, season checking is disabled for that series

OPEN QUESTIONS FOR PRODUCT OWNER
---------------------------------
1. What should drive the movie recommendation logic?
2. What filtering and sorting options are needed for the movie list?
3. Should a movie support multiple genres or just one?
4. Is this a single-user or multi-user system?
5. Should the system prevent duplicate movie entries?
6. Do we need edit and delete capabilities for movies?
7. Which movie attributes are mandatory vs optional?
8. Should there be search functionality to find specific movies?
9. Are there any constraints on data formats (URL validation, length format, etc.)?
10. Should the system track any additional information (date added, date watched, rating)?
